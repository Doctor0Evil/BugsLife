#BugsLife is a friendly, and ecologically-restorative system to provide a fair-chance for pest-control, and extermination-services to remain in-business, and pursue an alternate-path for pest-control that will-require less-resources, and still-allow normal-operations while reducing the ecologigal-destruction that is caused-by pest-control services, and poison-centers, or chemical-factories. The solution is: a simple signal-pattern research-operation, and maintenance-line of of non-harmful signal-emissions that deter pests, and insects away-from homes, and businesses instead-of harming, and/or killing/exterminating the pests.
